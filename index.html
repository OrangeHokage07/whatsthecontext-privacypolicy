        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          What's the Context? is a Chrome extension that helps you copy, highlight, and
          AI-process text from any webpage. We are committed to protecting your privacy.
          This policy explains what data is stored and how it is used.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
        <p>The following data is stored exclusively in your browser using <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. It never leaves your device except as described in the section below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text you copy or highlight on webpages</li>
          <li>Source URL, page title, and timestamp of each item</li>
          <li>Your AI provider name and model preference</li>
          <li>Your AI API key</li>
          <li>Saved browser sessions and tab lists</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Transmit</h2>
        <p>
          When you explicitly click <strong>Summarize</strong>, <strong>Rephrase</strong>,
          <strong>Proofread</strong>, or <strong>Translate</strong>, the selected text is
          sent over HTTPS directly to the AI provider you configured — OpenAI, Google Gemini,
          or Anthropic. This request is made from your browser directly to the provider's API.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not operate any servers. We do not receive or store any data ourselves.
          Only the text you explicitly submit for AI processing is transmitted, and only to
          the provider whose API key you have entered.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>

          <li>We do not track browsing history</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>storage</strong> — saves clipboard items, highlights, sessions, and settings locally</li>
          <li><strong>activeTab</strong> — reads the current page's URL and title to tag saved items</li>
          <li><strong>sidePanel</strong> — opens the extension's side panel</li>

          <li><strong>tabs</strong> — reads open tabs for the Save Session and Group Tabs features</li>
          <li><strong>tabGroups</strong> — creates Chrome tab groups when you use Group Tabs</li>
          <li><strong>alarms</strong> — schedules cleanup of expired local items every hour</li>
          <li><strong>host permissions (&lt;all_urls&gt;)</strong> — required so the text-selection bubble works on every website you visit</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          You can delete all locally stored data at any time by clicking
          <strong>"Clear &amp; Remove Key"</strong> in the extension settings panel, or by
